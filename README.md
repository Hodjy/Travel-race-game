# Travel-race-game
An original board game that I and my two friends created, using java and MVC pattern.

For playing the game please download "Travel-Race-Game.Jar"

The rules are simple:
Each player has his own cards hand, and in each turn, he can choose a card to help him with the game, or simply roll the dice to move forward.  
The first player that ends the game rounds faster, wins.

Each card has its own ability to help the player and to impact the game.
